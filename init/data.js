          DISCLAIMER:

          Please be aware that our home isn‚Äôt for everyone, especially for individuals who are highly sensitive to surrounding ' noise (e.g., insect chirping) or wild creatures. We designed our space to connect us to the natural elements and love it for its openness, but know that for others pursuing urban comfortless may not like it.
          Other things to note
          LOCATION :

          Sauca Villa is located in heart of Sidemen, a small village in East Bali
          which is about a 90-minute drive from Bali Airport and a 45-minute drive from Ubud. It is not yet a recognized touristic destination unlike Ubud, but this beautiful small village, which is sometimes called "Next Ubud" will guide you to the taste of old good Bali which cannot be seen in developed touristic places. It's just 15-20 minutes drive to well-know Sidemen village.

          Besides the incredible rice fields scenery and the indigenous culture, Sidemen is also surrounded by a lot of famous tourist destinations. Some of them include; Lempuyang Temple (The Gateway to Heaven), Besakih (The Mother Temple of Bali), Tirta Gangga Royal Water Palace, Telaga Waja River for Rafting, Amed Diving Spot, and Bias Putih the Virgin Beach.

          INTERNET:
          We have stable wifi with 50 mbps speed.

          MEALS:

          Western Breakfast per person is included in the price. As for lunch and dinner, you could order it from the closest restaurant. The menu is attached on dinning table. If you would like to have romantic dinner, the restaurant will serve you upon reservation. Please contact us for details.

          AIR CONDITIONER:

          Sauca villa is not equipped with air conditioners, but no worries at all. You will never need aircons in this villa situated in the high mountain area where you would rather want sweater or fleece jacket in the night. The home is architecturally designed to take advantage of the natural breezes that blow through the Mr.Agung to the Ocean. The average temperature year around at night in the terraces is around 21-22 degrees celsius and thus very comfortable to sleep.


          MOTORCYCLES:

          You can hire motorcycle to explore the surroundings. (talk with the caretakers for pricing which is lower than you hire from a vehicle rental shop). Please ask in the booking conversation or talk with our caretaker.

          INSECTS & BUGS (please read):

          The house is designed very openly and thus bugs, insects and frogs are common. Our beds have mosquito nets, but if you get scared of insects or bugs, this is not the right place for you and we recommend you to find somewhere else (concrete wall types of hotels) instead. We are after all in the middle of nature and that's what people love about our villa.

          TOWELS & LINEN:

          In the rainy season the towels and linen at times get damp and may start to smell. If you need replacements at any time during your stay, simply let the team know and they will supply you with fresh ones.


          TRANSPORTATION:

          If needed, we can help arranging transportation from/to the airport. Please let us know your wish upon reservation.`,

It has large windows that offer a great view of the mountains, a wood-burning fireplace for cozy evenings, a comfortable leather sofa, and a kitchen downstairs. Upstairs, you'll find two separate bedrooms: one with a double bed, and the second one with a bunk bed where the bottom part also fits two people.
        The space
        Our duplex is situated on the 4th floor of the "New Gudauri 2" apart hotel, located in the most contemporary area of Gudauri. The gondola lift is only 80 meters away. The building is equipped with central heating, an elevator, concierge service, security personnel, video surveillance, and a ski storage room. On the -1 floor, there's a spa center with a small pool, sauna, and gym (available for an extra fee). Additionally, a bar within the building offers a selection of European beers and both Georgian and European cuisine. Nearby, in the adjacent building, you'll find restaurants, cafes, and a grocery store. For those arriving by car, there's free public parking available in the courtyard.

The second bedroom features a bunk bed (bottom: 130 x 190 cm, top: 90 x 190 cm), providing flexible sleeping arrangements for your convenience.

        This duplex offers much more than a place to rest; it's an invitation to immerse yourself in the enchanting ambiance of New Gudauri. Whether you're relishing the breathtaking mountain views from your window, sharing stories by the warm fireplace, or simply enjoying a quiet evening after a day on the slopes, this space guarantees comfort and tranquility. Its strategic location near the lift, coupled with its cozy interior, promises a memorable and soothing stay in the heart of the mountains.

        Guests can access all the luxury they want in all communal areas.

You are welcome to make your own breakfast in the kitchen. There is also the possibility of having breakfast in a small bakery, which can be reached in 5 minutes.

It should offer musicians a comfortable and inexpensive place to stay. You don't have to vacate your room at 10 a.m. the next morning, and you can also use the music room for a day-off overnight stay or a longer stay. It is equipped with a mixer and PA, Yamaha CP 80 grand piano, Hartke Bass Amp., Fender Princeton, 2 Marshall JCM Dual Reverbs and a drum kit. Non-musicians are of course also welcome.

It also has air conditioning (hot and cold), fan, 43"Smart TV with Netflix, fast WiFi and barbecue.
          The space
          Rustic tropical site, a great option for those who want to stay close to the beaches of Ilhabela with a green area with waterfall practically on the balcony of their home, seeking contact with nature, peace, tranquility and restore energies.

          The site was one of the great tourist attractions of the island in the 80/90s and today we share the old water park exclusively with our guests. The river has three waterfalls. Two waterfalls divide the river into 2 wells with weak current (most of the time) automatically forming natural pools. The riverfront on the top side is quite spacious, perfect for sunbathing after swimming and has a large slide for adventurers.

          As the river cuts through the terrain, access to the other side is by a bridge, leading to trails in the Atlantic forest. Other attractions of the space are the other two natural pools with toboggan. One of them is small and shallow for children and people who just want to get their foot/knee wet. The other is large and deeper with a long slide.

          Spread over our land inside our site we have a total of 8 accommodations that we rent an independent one without being shared:

          Loose on the land where we also accept dogs we have :

          - The two-story chalet that is the one in this listing with a maximum of 2 people.

          - The white house surrounded by a wall with its own backyard with a pool and barbecue area where there are up to 6 people in the max. It has 2 suites, the first floor, with a view of the stars from the King bed and the bathtub. The large balcony on the first floor has a pool table and a lookout for the river.

          - The European chalet completely made of wood with a fireplace among our pine forest where they fit in the max. 4 people. with 2 bedrooms and a bathroom.


          In the 2-story complex/ building are the following accommodations where we do not accept animals:

          - The Cococana apartment on two floors, on the ground floor has the kitchen, dining room and living room with ample balcony facing the main part of the river.

          Guest access
          Guests of this listing will have access to all the outdoor areas and its attractions of the old water park, such as the river area with toboggan, the natural pools with toboggans, the barbecues, game room and trails in the woods across the river. Access to other accommodations and their private areas is only allowed if they are from the same group or with permission/invitation from those who will be renting.
          Other things to note
          We are in the middle of nature and with that there are many species of animals here and "dirt" from the forest (leaves, tree dust). Both the beautiful and diverse birds (parrots, toucans, woodpeckers, etc.), butterflies such as wild animals and insects are part of the scenery, for example spiders that make their webs overnight in the outdoor areas. With all nature there is no possibility of keeping the external areas 100% without dust, foliage etc. because 1 wind already brings everything again.
          We also have of course the trademark of Ilhabela - the rubberies. The tip here is to pass repellent every half hour, so you can better enjoy the stay, both on the site and on the beaches. The night is not hot!

          On the property we have the Dalmatian dogs - the Zap and the Maia-vira-lata, from the housekeeper, our Pomeranian Lulu - Pomi, who is most of the time at home, our two cats who only stay inside our house.

          The waterfalls in the photos as well as the color of the river may change in the amount of water due to periods of drought and plenty of rain, as well as the flowers have their seasons to bloom.
          As we rent the space particularly we do not have lifeguards, monitors, etc. ie the use of attractions here is under 100% responsibility of guests which is one of the house rules that they must accept if they make the reservation.

          The property is far from the street so there is almost no noise outside of what nature provides. Quiet and quiet place, we have two neighbors, one on each side, one being an inn and the other a family home.

          At the entrance of the land lives the housekeeper and his family, who are super polite and calm people and always willing to help if necessary.

          On the land there is the complex/building where 1 apartment, 3 apartments and a suite for rent with independent entrances, one on the ground floor suitable for wheelchair users and stroller and two on the 1st floor. These have a partition on the balcony and if a group (up to 6 people) closes the reservation of the two flats the balconies can be connected.
          We also have inside the site 2 cottages and a house scattered around the land.

          We have high speed internet/wifi (1000 Mbps fiber optic connection) connected to a No break (internet only) if the light goes out the internet continues to work and we also have a internet line from Vivo back up if the main one doesn't work.
          Each home has min. from an Amazon Alexa Echo Dot (3rd generation), which is a smart speaker for music and general questions.

          Our guests have a bath towel for each person and a hand towel in the bathrooms. We offer a change of towels in the middle of the stay from 7 nights.
          We also provide sheets, pillows, pillows and microfiber blankets.
